          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>I originally thought lower income states would have a larger obesity rate.  This chart suprised me by showing a weaker 
            correlation between the two variables than I had originally thought. None of the records show a state 
            with an obese population of under 20%. </p>

          <p>You can see that a higher rate of poverty generally correlates with a higher level of obesity. But the state with the least poverty (New Hampshire) had an obesity level of 27.4. 
              While the state with the highest poverty percentage (Mississippi) has an obesity level of 35%. </p>

          <p>What this tells me is that though higher levels of poverty tend to mean higher levels of obesity, there are likely other factors that go into 
              the amount of obese people within a population. Such as food choices, available exercise habits, modes of transportation, etc.</p>
